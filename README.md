# Django Rest Framework (DRF) Course
Welcome to this full Django Rest Framework (DRF)course. 
This course is perfect if you are looking to learn DRF and build your own API application.
***
***

## Prerequisites
- Python=>3.10

## Considerations
I have added optional docker containers to simplify the build. If you want to use the docker build you should install Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.

We will be calling our API throughout the next 8 modules. I have written the requests in (Curl)[https://curl.se/] and (Httpie)[https://httpie.io/]. 

(Httpie)[https://httpie.io/] provides a clean terminal output which is handy for this type of project. You will need to install it locally if you want to use the commands.
>Note: (Httpie)[https://httpie.io/] is pre-installed in the docker container.

## Getting started
First you will need to clone down the first module.

1) Create a new directory on your local machine. I have called mine drf_course. This is your 'root directory'.

2) Open a terminal and cd into the root directory.

3) You can now clone the first module. You can do this a few different ways. I use SSH...

```
#option 1 - SSH
git clone --module_1 git@github.com:bobby-didcoding/drf_course.git .

#option 2 - Github CLI
gh repo clone bobby-didcoding/drf_course .
git checkout module_1

#option 3 - HTTPS
git clone --branch module_1 https://github.com/bobby-didcoding/drf_course.git .
```
